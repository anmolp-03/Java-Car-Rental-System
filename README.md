# Java-Car-Rental-System

The system includes two types of cars: Luxury and Economy. 
A customer must enter their details and then select the type and model of a car to rent from the menu. Based on the car's availability, the customer will either be allotted the car or not.
The 'CustomerWriter' class provides functionality to persist customer information in a text file, allowing the car rental system to maintain a record of its customers. This adds a layer of data persistence, ensuring that customer information is stored beyond the runtime of the program.
